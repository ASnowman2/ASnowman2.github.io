This Twine narrative demonstrates the digital skills that I have learned throughout the completion of my undergraduate degree in History. I emulated a format that one might encounter in a museum setting and consciously kept that audience in mind through the script. This project shows that I possess research skills and can convert academic historical information into an understandable, objective, and accessible format for the public. Useful digital skills to note in this narrative are the ability to format text color, font, and sizing, embedding multimedia, and the use of conditionals, variables, and input functions to give the user an interactive experience.
